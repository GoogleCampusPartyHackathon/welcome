### THANK YOU

A big thanks goes out to the creators and maintainers of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) because they make it so easy to create a site like this with awesome features like responsive design included.

Another thank you is due to the people of [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) for providing free themes for Bootstrap.

Also thanks goes out to the fine folks of GitHub to build such a great platform and let everybody share open source code and collaborate for free. You rock!
